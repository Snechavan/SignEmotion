# SignEmotion
I built an interactive ML-powered signature emotion predictor that decodes emotions from signature images.💥
🔧 Here's what I accomplished:

🔹️ Key Highlights:
📂 Uploaded a signature 🖊️
🧹 Preprocessed the image to standardize it 🖼️
📊 Extracted key features like stroke length and direction using OpenCV 🔍
🌲Trained a Random Forest Classifier on a simulated dataset
✅ Achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set 

🎭 Predicted the emotion behind the uploaded signature (e.g., 😊 Happy, 😔 Sad, 😡 Angry, 😐 Neutral)!

💻 Tech Stack:
Python 🐍 | OpenCV 🖼️ | Scikit-learn 📊 | NumPy 🔢 | Matplotlib 📉
